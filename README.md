# SDIS_PROJECT
Implementation of MQTT and CoAP

Authors: Cesar Junior and Frederico Ramos
The objective of this work is to develop a MQTT Broker, applying the concepts studied in the Distributed Systems course. Following the theoretical approach, a practical implementation will be carried out, allowing for the exploration of the broker's operation in the pub/sub model and message management. 



The intended specifications for this work are:

•	TCP/IP communication between the Broker and MQTT Clients.

•	Quality of Service (QoS) 1 as a minimum.

•	Dynamic management of Clients and their respective topics (Pub/Sub).

•	Code written in C and C++.



The planned final implementation will be:
Broker → PC (Linux)
MQTT Clients → 2 PCs + 2 microcontrollers (Esp32 and Esp8266)
